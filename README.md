# beliefs-in-social-networks
An agent-based emergent model of the propagation of beliefs throughout social networks.

This repo holds the work for my term project for CSDS 491 at CWRU: Artificial Intelligence: Probabilistic Graphical Models. The project was done in conjunction with my classmate Marcelo Beramendi Caballero.

The code was originally written and ran in a Google Colab Notebook. Since there is not a history of commits reflecting our contributions to the project, here is an overview of how our work was divided:

- The design and implementation for the model of individual conversations and updating of beliefs was done by Marcelo.
- The implementation of the graphical structure in the Person (node) and Relationship (edge) classes was done by Daniel.
- The creation of the many example networks were done by both of us.
